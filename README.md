# Material for BioAI seminar

This repository contains material for the BioAI seminar on *Elevating Scientific Computing at Simula: Best Practices in Modern Software Development.*

The seminar is organized in a very hands-on and interactive way where we will first present some theory and then do a live demo before we ask you to solve a related exercise.
The agenda is as follows

- Code and Data repositories
- Reproducible environments
- Linters, formatters and continuous integration
- Documentation
- Example paper with code
- Packaging and Distribution (if time)
