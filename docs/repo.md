# Code and Data repositories

## Agenda

- Why version control systems
    - Why do we need version control systems.
    - Why it is good to track the history of a project and understand why certain decisions where made
- What is GitHub?
    - Collaboration with other through code review
    - Pull requests process
    - Issue tracking
- Releases and tags
    - Create a release with a tags for specific version that you want to easily be able to go back to, e.g when you submit a paper or when a paper is published.
    - Creating a changelog to show what has been changed between releases.
- Data repositories and data sharing
    - How to share data. This should typically not be in a git repo, but rather on a data repository such as Zenodo.
    - How to deal with the case when it is not possible to share data (Generate synthetic data).
