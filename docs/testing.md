# Getting started with testing in python

## Agenda

- Why we need tests?
- Test driven development
    - Go through a toy example (perhaps testing an encryption / decryption algorithm)
    - Show how to write tests in a TDD fashion
    - Show how to create parametrized tests
- Linters, formatters and pre-commit hooks
    - Go through why it is good to use linters and formatters
    - Go through pre-commit hooks and how to set it up
- Continuous Integration
    - Show how to set it up so that you can run your tests and linters / formatters / pre-commit hooks using GitHub actions
