  - Github Actions
  - Azure DevOps
  - Circle CI

  - List of [CI-services](https://github.com/ligurio/awesome-ci)
* We will use Github Actions

---

## Create a workflow

* Create folder `.github/workflows`
* Add a `name_of_workflow.yml`

---

## When should the workflow be executed?

name: Build documentation and upload artifact
```yaml
on:
  pull_request:
    branches: main
  push:
    branches:
      - "*"
    tags:
      - "v*"
  workflow_call:
  workflow_dispatch:
```

---

### Run on pull-request
```yaml
on:
  pull_request:
    branches: main
```
* Workflow is triggered whenever a pull request is made against the main branch
* Can make a list of branches, or include all (`"*"`, or no branch `"!*"` or patterns `"v*"``)
